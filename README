database/bfdatabase.db contains all the data (flight and econ combined)

Please don't commit to master nor to database (i.e. don't run conn.commit())!

To get data from database, modify readdbexample.py and then run 'python readdbexample'

If you're confused about the names of the columns, run:

```python
c.execute('SELECT * FROM <your table>')
print(list(map(lambda x: x[0], c.description)))
```
